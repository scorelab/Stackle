# Introduction
Stackle is a web communication portal aimed at providing Open Source organizations a platform to have discussions on their GitHub projects and their issues. It provides GitHub integration which allows the administrator of an organization to create a forum thread for the particular organization. Users signing in are able to view forums of the organizations they contribute to and engage in the forum discussions.

# Implementation Details
MEAN stack is used for developing Stackle.
 - Front-End is developed using Angular
 - Back-end is handled by NodeJS using Express
 - MongoDB is used as the databases for storing data related to stackle

# Architecture
Users interact with the application through the Angular front-end which communicates with Node-API to get and post data to the MongoDB server. The front-end also communicates with GitHub API to get data related to Users, repositories and organizations. Users can login to the application through auth0 login integrated to Stackle.

# Setting Up the Project
These are the instructions on how to setup the project locally.

## Pre-requisites
* NodeJS 6.X or higher
* MongoDB Community edition

## Installing MongoDB

### On Windows
1. Download the lastest production release of MongoDB (3.4.6 or higher) from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community).
2. Create the data directory to store all data. Create a the directory on the drive from which you start MongoDB. (Ex: If you are starting the MongoDB from the drive 'C'. You should create the directory as C:\data\db\ ).
3. To start the MongoDB, fire up a command line and run **mongod.exe** (ex: "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe" )
4. To connect to the MongoDB, use the **mongo.exe** shell. For that open up a command line an run *mongo*. (Ex: "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongo.exe" ).

For more information refer the [MongoDB manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) on installing MongoDB Community edtion.

### On Mac

1. Download the binary files for the desired release of MongoDB.
Download the binaries from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).
2. Extract the files from the downloaded archive.
For example, from a system shell, you can extract through the tar command:
```tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-3.6.3.tgz```
3. Copy the extracted archive to the target directory.
Copy the extracted folder to the location from which MongoDB will run.
```mkdir -p mongodb```
```cp -R -n mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-3.6.3/ mongodb```
4. Ensure the location of the binaries is in the PATH variable.
The MongoDB binaries are in the bin/ directory of the archive. To ensure that the binaries are in your PATH, you can modify your PATH.
For example, you can add the following line to your shellâ€™s rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc):
```export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH```
Replace <mongodb-install-directory> with the path to the extracted MongoDB archive.

## On Linux
For Ubuntu,SUSE, and Debian systems, you can install mongoDB Community Edition using .deb packages. The process varies from distro to distro, so I suggest you visit the link below, select your distribution.

Ubuntu terminal command:
`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org`
Debian terminal command:
`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org`
SUSE terminal command:
`sudo zypper -n install mongodb-org`

## Stackle API
1. `cd` in to the **stackle_api** directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the packages required.
3. Once all the packages are installed run `npm start`

## Stackle App
Make sure you have the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) installed.
1. `cd` in to the **stackle-app** directory
2. Run `npm install` to install the packages required.
3. Once all the packages are installed, run `npm start` or `ng serve -o`

## Running Tests (Protractor)
1. Run `npm install -g protractor` to install protractor globally.
2. To get started with a Selenium Server, run
   ```
   webdriver-manager update
   webdriver-manager start
   ```
3. `cd` in to **root** directory and run `./ui-tests.sh`
4. To add more tests, edit **stackle_tests.js** located in **stackle_app**

# Running with Docker
1. Change the url in the database config file in stackle_api/config/database.js  as `url : 'mongodb://mongo:27017/stackle'`
2. In the root of the Stackle directory, run `docker-compose build`
   - If you are on Linux machine, execute the following steps to install compose.
     ```
     sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.17.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     ```
3. Once build completes, run `docker-compose up`
